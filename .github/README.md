Experimenting with some basic programming in Java. "Basic programming" includes:

+ A "de Morgan flavored" cubical type theory with redtt flavored cubes (the so-called "extension types")
+ Inductive types with pattern matching (hopefully) and "simpler indices" (see my TyDe paper)
+ An equalizer of the first projection of evaluation and just the first projection :trollface:
